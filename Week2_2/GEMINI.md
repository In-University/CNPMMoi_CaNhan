Rules for this session:

1. Always ignore unnecessary or heavy files and folders such as:
   - node_modules/
   - dist/
   - build/
   - .git/
   - *.log

2. When installing packages, you must always use "pnpm".
   - Do not use "npm" or "yarn" under any circumstances.
   - Example: use "pnpm add axios" instead of "npm install axios".

3. When working with files:
   - Always base your output strictly on the provided file content.
   - Do not invent, rewrite, or modify code beyond what is explicitly requested.
   - Preserve the original structure and logic unless instructed otherwise.

4. When generating output:
   - First, complete the full source code or file content exactly as requested.
   - Only after the code is fully presented, provide the terminal commands needed to run or build the project.
   - Do not mix code and terminal commands in the same block.

5. Follow these rules consistently across all tasks in this session.
